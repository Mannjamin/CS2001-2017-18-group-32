Make sure you talk about every aspect of the app (back end, front end, design, ect.)

explain how you planned and went about engineering your solution (star method)
protype tools (pen and paper (simple and easy), POP(reccomended in lecture), website, android studio(basic views))
Multiple iterations
Maybe changes based on feedback
Maybe indursty feedback about userbase
Limitations: 
After the website version not many changes were made
Refrences (look at lectures)
(Maybe refrence to reviews)
Talk about gannt chart and how differrent reality was


Question, peronsa, analysis

Analysis: similar apps,  take insparation
Question: Public opinion, feedback
Flowchart: Looked at technical aspects o the app and got requirments(idea for system alarm)
Personas: Couldn't get access to a wide variety of people, gave us a better idea of the users needs
 
Refrence group report



link back specific design bits to usabilty engineering principles
Note that as this section assesses your application of usability 
engineering principles, you will need to describe which principles you have applied, and show how they have driven your interaction design, using references where necessary to support these. 
topics relating to cognition, perception (eg. affordances, depth cues), attention, memory, and other design-relevant guidance (feedback, visibility, etc). 
include time selection for schedule (lots to talk about)

Talk about in what ways our designs are good/bad why theyre good/bad 
what we couldve improved
what we wouldve done had we had the time
Critical friend (Stasha)
	We got the idea to provide conctrete feedback for when something happens
	Make more of an effort on the colour schemes(look at android material website for refrence) contrasting colours
	WE could've had a colour blind option	
Potential User evaluations

System status- 	Save changes
		Connected
		
Real world match- Digital alarm clock

user control- 	Save to make changes

Consistency- 	Help button always in the same place
		Apply, or save changes or whatever. But be consistent.

Error prevention- Save changes

Recognition- Symbols along with words

maybe we couldve inculded a technical mode for industry/techincal people

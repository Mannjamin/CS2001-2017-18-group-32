# Ideas for our development project.

## Hello Group 32, add your ideas here:

Sam- 
I was thinking the app would focus more on displaying the statistics that the sensors would collect.
So the main pages would have a graph or some other way to show the data and would then have a way to edit the optimal ranges for the light and temperature. A switch to turn the sensors and/or the LEDs off and on might also be a good idea. 
I'll include my UI designs in the media section of the repository.

Here are some links to the prototypes I showed in the meeting today:

[Slider Protoype](https://marvelapp.com/47bgjcf)

[Dial Protoype](https://marvelapp.com/11j09dh6). (This one is less developed and most of the buttons don't work. It's mostly a concept thing.)


Mohammed-

Light Switch: Switch the lights on/off using the app/
              Include a timer function( Lights to be turned off after X amount of hours) or Lights to be turned off       automatically during daylight
